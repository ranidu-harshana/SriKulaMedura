# Poject Description
<p align="justify">The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive online web application for a dress renting company
to replace their existing manual system. The web application will provide customers with a convenient
and user-friendly platform to browse, select, and book dresses for rental, while also offering efficient
inventory management and administrative functionalities for the company. Not only that we are going to
develop a user-friendly interface where customers can browse through a wide range of dress options,
including images, descriptions, sizes, and availability status. When integrating secure payment gateways
to facilitate online transactions, allowing customers to make rental payments using various payment
methods such as credit/debit cards. Create an intuitive dashboard for the company administrators to
manage dress inventory, view and process bookings, generate reports, and access customer information.
Provide administrative controls for adding, editing, and removing dresses from the catalog. Another thing
is to incorporate reporting and analytics features to generate insights on dress rentals, popular choices,
customer preferences, and other key performance indicators. This data can help the company make
informed decisions to enhance their services and improve business strategies.</p>
