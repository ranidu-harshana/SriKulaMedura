To replace their current manual system, the project's objective is to create a full online web application for a dress rental business. Customers will be able to browse, choose, and reserve dresses for rental via the web application, which will also offer effective inventory management and administrative features for the business. Additionally, we'll create a user-friendly interface so that clients can browse a variety of dress alternatives, complete with photographs, descriptions, sizes, and availability information. Allowing consumers to pay for their rental payments online utilizing a variety of payment methods, such as credit/debit cards, when connecting secure payment gateways.Create an easy-to-use dashboard that the company's managers can use to manage the inventory of dresses, see and handle reservations, generate reports, and access customer data. Give users the ability to add, edit, and remove dresses from the catalog using administrative permissions. Adding reporting and analytics tools can also help you to produce insights on dress rentals, popular selections, client preferences, and other vital performance factors. The organization can use this information to influence decisions about how to better their offerings and corporate tactics.
